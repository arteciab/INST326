This week I did not use AI while completing the exercises. As for my project team, I am currently in a group of two. 
My partner just joined, and we haven’t had the opportunity to collaborate yet, so I am not sure how he has used AI so far.
I do plan to use AI in the future to include Gemini, Claude, etc. but I have not had the chance to try them out yet.

This week, I did not use AI while completing the Assignments. My project team is currently a group of two, and my partner and I have not had the chance to collaborate on the design and development of our Data retrieval and Analysis Tool at this point. Since we haven’t had the opportunity to collaborate aside from the Charter, I’m unsure how he has used AI so far. Although I haven’t used AI tools for this class yet, I plan to incorporate them moving forward and for the project that we will design throughout the semester. In particular, I’d like to explore tools like Gemini and Claude to help us learn how to build and refine our motocross data retrieval and analysis tool for the team project, as long as my teammate agrees.

This week I did not use AI while completing the exercises. As for my project team, I am currently in a group of two. 
My partner and I will have the opporunity to collab this week, which could change that for next week.
I do plan to use AI in the future to include Gemini, Claude, etc. but I have not had the chance to try them out yet.

This week, I worked on the exercises independently to review and apply python concepts that we have learned so far. I relied on the class lectures, discussions, materials, notes, and online documentation to understand these concepts. I completed all exercises without the use of AI. I still plan to use AI in the future for group projects if my teammates agree.
